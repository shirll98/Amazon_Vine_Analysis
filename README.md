# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the project 
In this project, I used PySpark library to perform ETL on a set of amazon review data. First I extracted, transformed, and connected it to AWS RDS then loaded it into my local pgAdmin. I chose video game reviews as my Amazon review dataset. 
## Results
The total number of paid reviews is 94 and total of unpaid reviews is 40471. The total number of paid 5 star reviews is 48 while the total number of unpaid 5 star reviews is 15663. The percentage of paid 5 star reviews is 51% while the percentage of unpaid 5 star reviews is 38%.  

## Summary 
From the analysis, on amazon review webpage for video games there are about 51% of 5 star reviews and only 39% of the 5 star reviews were unpaid 5 star reviews. This demonstrates a bias for positive reviews in the video game category. An additional analysis is to determine the distribution of the statistics by calculating the mean, medium, and mode of the dataset of 5 star reviews that were paid and unpaid.
